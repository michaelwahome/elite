# Elite Primary School System

This is a java system built for the administration of an imaginary primary school, Elite Primary School. It allows parents to login and view the marks of the students registered under them, teachers to login and update student marks and financial administrators to login and update student fees paid, as well as total fees expected for these students.

It is an individual project that was made as a part of my coursework for Object Oriented Programming I, a second year unit in my Bachelor's of Informatics and Computer Science course. It is made using Java and is yet to be completed.
